The AI sought clarification by asking for more details about the project, specifically regarding the project elements. The user then specified the addition of a navbar featuring \"home,\" \"about,\" and \"contact\" fields. The assistant, in response to the evolving project requirements, provided a list of additional features the user might consider implementing, including a \"New Products\" section in the navbar, social media links in the footer, a \"Favorites\" feature for saving products, a user profile page for personalized recommendations, a search bar for quick product searches, and incorporating user reviews on product pages. Out of these features, the user opted to implement the \"New Products\" section, the \"Favorites\" feature, and the search bar, while deferring decisions on the social media links, user profile page, and user reviews. Additionally, the assistant posed two questions regarding the login form's visibility options and the inclusion of a \"Remember me\" feature for user convenience.\nUser: add a simple login form component below the footer\nUser: add a simple login form component below the footer\nUser: add a simple login form component below the footer\nUser: add a simple login form component below the footer\nThis is the user's current request of changes to be made: add a simple login form component below the footer"
